# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for Autodarts Tools.

## Setup and Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will use WXT to build and load the extension in Chrome.

3. For Firefox development:
   ```
   yarn dev:firefox
   ```

## Build Commands

- Build for production:
  ```
  yarn build
  ```

- Build Firefox version:
  ```
  yarn build:firefox
  ```

- Create distribution zip:
  ```
  yarn zip
  ```

## Development Tips

- Use `Alt+T` to reload the extension during development
- WXT automatically rebuilds when files change
- Check the browser console for errors and logs
- Background script logs can be viewed in the extension's background service worker console

## Debugging

- Content scripts can be debugged through the browser's devtools on the target page
- Background scripts can be debugged through the extension's dedicated devtools
- The WXT development server provides helpful error messages

## Code Organization

- Follow Vue file structure guidelines in `.cursor/rules/vue-file-structure.mdc`
- Use the feature component pattern for new features in `.cursor/rules/feature-settings.mdc`
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use TailwindCSS for styling

## Testing

- Manual testing on autodarts.io is required for feature verification
- Test on both Chrome and Firefox before releasing

## Release Process

1. Increment version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new changes
3. Build for production: `yarn build`
4. Create zip file: `yarn zip`
5. Publish to browser extension stores
